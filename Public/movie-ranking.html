<hr>

<H3> Amelie </H3>
<p> I love this foreign film because of Amelies michevious ways and sense of adventure.</p>

<H3> It's a Beautiful Life</H3>

<p>Another foreign film set during WWII and the Nazi occupation of Italy. It's a delightful movie based on faith and to never give up hope.</p>

<h3>The Hangover</h3>

<p> A campy fun film that's an incredibly great waste of time.</p>
